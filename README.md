# The Compass Script Collection

This a master repository of script submodules, designed and created to automate some of the mundane operational tasks at The Compass. Many of these involve manipulating data in the proprietary `.docx` and `.xlsx` formats. In the future, The Compass anticipates switching to the manipulation and transformation of RAW data in a full stack system.
